- on the first str(df)
  we can see the variables data type and some are incorrect (rate, price) as chr
  we can also observe kzProductName instead of ProductName
  we can also observe the kzProductNames row values (not clean), same with Review and Summary
  
  [change kzProductNames to ProductNames, clean the Summary and Summary
  correct the data types of variables

- on the first total
  we can see that obs and the (num_pos + num_neg + num_neu) are not equal, so we investigate
  
  correct the values for Sentiment

to sort data in showing most frequent value
The table() function in R is used to create a table that shows the frequency of occurrence of different values in a variable or a set of variables. For example, if you have a column in a dataset that contains the names of different types of fruits, you can use the table() function to count how many times each type of fruit appears in the column.
The output of the table() function is a table that shows the counts of each unique value in the variable. Each row of the table represents a unique value, and the columns show the counts of that value in each category or group.
Using the table() function can be helpful when you want to get a quick overview of the distribution of values in a variable or when you want to compare the frequency of different values across categories or groups. It is often used as a first step in exploratory data analysis to get a sense of the data before diving into more complex analyses.
